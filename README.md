# Elucidata_assignment

First you need to run app.py in cmd then the local server starts running.
then you need to open the local server url which open a html page with 2 options upload a file and submit

I am using a .csv files of the data set which is present in tha flask folder

after uploading that file you need to click submit.

after submitting a new html page is opened in the background the outputs of the first task will be automatically downloaded in ths flask folder.

now you will see a msg that files have been created and click next task to perform the next api operation

then the second task will be completeted and you will be redirected to another html page which shows the action performed and you should press next step

now the third task will be performed in the background and output will be downloaded in the flask folder, and you will see "task completed" on the html page.

Task is done!
